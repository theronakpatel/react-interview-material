# Quick Reference: Common Interview Questions & Answers

## Technical Questions

### 1. "What is the DOM?"
**Answer**: "The DOM (Document Object Model) is like a tree structure that represents your HTML page. Think of it as a family tree where each HTML element is a family member. For example, if you have a webpage with a header, navigation, and main content, the DOM creates a tree where the `<html>` is the grandparent, `<body>` is the parent, and `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<main>` are the children. When you want to change something on the page (like updating text or adding a new element), you're actually modifying this DOM tree. The browser then re-renders the page to show your changes."

### 2. "Explain the Virtual DOM in React"
**Answer**: "The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. When state changes, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree, compares it with the previous one (diffing), and updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM. This makes React efficient by minimizing expensive DOM operations. For example, if I have a list of 1000 items and only one changes, React will only update that specific item instead of re-rendering the entire list."

### 3. "How do you optimize React performance?"
**Answer**: "I use several strategies: React.memo for component memoization, useMemo for expensive calculations, useCallback for function memoization, and React.lazy for code splitting. I also implement virtual scrolling for large lists, optimize bundle size with tree shaking, and use React DevTools Profiler to identify bottlenecks. For example, in a trading dashboard, I'd memoize chart components and use virtual scrolling for stock lists."

### 4. "Explain state management in Vue 3"
**Answer**: "Vue 3 offers multiple approaches. The Composition API with reactive() and ref() for local state, Pinia for global state management with better TypeScript support than Vuex, and provide/inject for dependency injection. For a trading app, I'd use Pinia to manage user portfolio, watchlist, and real-time stock data, with reactive() for component-specific state like form inputs."

### 5. "How do you handle real-time data in a frontend application?"
**Answer**: "I use WebSocket connections for real-time updates, implement connection pooling and reconnection logic, use debouncing for rapid updates, and implement optimistic UI updates. For error handling, I use error boundaries and fallback states. In a trading context, I'd also implement data validation, handle connection failures gracefully, and use service workers for offline functionality."

### 6. "What's your approach to testing frontend applications?"
**Answer**: "I use a testing pyramid: unit tests for components and utilities, integration tests for user flows, and E2E tests for critical paths. I use Jest for unit testing, React Testing Library for component testing, and Cypress for E2E. I also implement visual regression testing and performance testing. For a trading app, I'd focus on testing real-time data handling, form validations, and error scenarios."

## System Design Questions

### 1. "Design a real-time trading dashboard"
**Answer**: "I'd start with the requirements: real-time data, thousands of concurrent users, mobile responsiveness, and offline capability. Architecture: WebSocket connections for real-time data, Redis for caching, CDN for static assets, and service workers for offline functionality. Frontend: React/Vue with virtual scrolling, code splitting, and performance monitoring. I'd also implement error boundaries, connection pooling, and graceful degradation."

### 2. "How would you build a component library?"
**Answer**: "I'd start with design tokens and a design system, use Storybook for documentation, implement accessibility features (ARIA, keyboard navigation), add TypeScript definitions, and write comprehensive tests. I'd use CSS-in-JS or CSS modules for styling, implement theming support, and create a build system with tree shaking. For a financial app, I'd focus on data visualization components and form components."

## Behavioral Questions

### 1. "How do you take ownership of frontend systems?"
**Answer**: "I start by understanding business requirements and user needs. I create technical roadmaps, establish coding standards, implement monitoring and alerting, and mentor junior developers. I regularly communicate with stakeholders, track KPIs, and proactively identify and address technical debt. For example, at my last role, I took ownership of a slow dashboard and improved performance by 70% through optimization."

### 2. "Describe a complex technical challenge you solved"
**Answer**: "I optimized a trading dashboard that was slow with real-time data. The challenge was handling 10,000+ stock symbols with live updates. I implemented virtual scrolling, memoization, WebSocket connection pooling, and data normalization. I also added performance monitoring and error boundaries. The result was 70% faster load times and better user experience."

### 3. "How do you work with design and product teams?"
**Answer**: "I involve myself early in the design process, asking questions about user flows and technical constraints. I provide feedback on feasibility and suggest improvements based on technical capabilities. I use tools like Figma for collaboration and create prototypes to validate ideas. I also ensure the final implementation matches the design while maintaining performance and accessibility."

### 4. "How do you handle conflicting requirements?"
**Answer**: "I gather all stakeholders to understand the root cause of conflicts. I present data-driven solutions and explain trade-offs. I prioritize based on business impact and user needs. For example, if there's a conflict between adding features and performance, I'd propose a phased approach or find ways to optimize existing code to accommodate both."

## Problem-Solving Questions

### 1. "Debug a slow React application"
**Answer**: "I'd start by using React DevTools Profiler to identify slow components, check for unnecessary re-renders, look for memory leaks, and analyze bundle size. I'd implement React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback where appropriate. I'd also check for expensive operations in render methods and optimize them."

### 2. "Handle a production bug"
**Answer**: "I'd first assess the impact and rollback if necessary. I'd reproduce the issue locally, check error logs and monitoring tools, and create a fix. I'd write tests to prevent regression and deploy with feature flags if possible. I'd also communicate with stakeholders and document the incident for future reference."

## Code Review Questions

### 1. "What do you look for in a code review?"
**Answer**: "I check for code quality, performance implications, security issues, accessibility, test coverage, and adherence to coding standards. I look for potential bugs, edge cases, and opportunities for optimization. I also ensure the code is maintainable and well-documented."

### 2. "How do you give constructive feedback?"
**Answer**: "I focus on the code, not the person. I explain the reasoning behind my suggestions and provide examples when possible. I acknowledge good practices and suggest improvements constructively. I also ask questions to understand the developer's perspective and ensure we're aligned on goals."

## Leadership Questions

### 1. "How do you mentor junior developers?"
**Answer**: "I provide regular feedback, pair program on complex tasks, review their code thoroughly, and encourage them to ask questions. I help them understand best practices and architectural decisions. I also give them opportunities to lead small projects and present their work to the team."

### 2. "How do you handle technical disagreements?"
**Answer**: "I focus on data and evidence rather than opinions. I present pros and cons of different approaches and explain the reasoning behind my recommendations. I'm open to being convinced by better arguments and always prioritize what's best for the project and users."
